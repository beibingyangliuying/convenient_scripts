# Introduction

This repository is intended to provide a number of ready to use Python scripts which can be performed with a properly
configured Python environment.

The individual scripts are relatively independent, their usages are pointed out through filenames.

# Environment Configuration

Please refer to [references.txt]() for environment configuration. The version of Python I am currently using is 3.10.

Configure your Python environment through powershell:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you need to access a mirror site, as follows:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```
