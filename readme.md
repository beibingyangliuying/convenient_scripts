# Overview

This is `convenient_scripts`, the reason I created this project was to integrate Python scripts that I would use in my daily work. 

These Python scripts are located in the `src` folder, and I've made two categories so far:
- `latex`.
- `document_converter`.

Each script runs independently and their purpose is self-explanatory.
